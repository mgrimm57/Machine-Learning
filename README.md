# Machine-Learning-Python

In this repository, I am holding a bunch of python code centered around machine learning. In this repository, you will find code used to...

- Show bias variance tradeoff
- Exploit bayes rule and choice of prior and posterior distribution
- Show how neural networks work
- Introduce perception learning through an example of photo identification
